1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How long has it been since I've forgotten about you?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Tell me about your favorite story

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I think of you very much

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I think of you very much

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think of you very much

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I start to panic

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did I do something wrong?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You cry and say to me

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The pain is all lies

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't be your prince

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Maybe you don't understand

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
From the day you said you loved me

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My sky is cold

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I wish to become a fairy

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The angel you love

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Open your hands and become wings

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
To protect you

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You have to believe

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Believe that we will share the same story

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Happiness and happiness are the ending

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How long has it been since I've forgotten about you?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You cry and say to me

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The pain is all lies

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't be your prince

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe you don't understand

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
From the day you said you loved me

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000

Open your hands and become wings

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will become a fairy

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The angel you love

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Open your hands and become wings

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
