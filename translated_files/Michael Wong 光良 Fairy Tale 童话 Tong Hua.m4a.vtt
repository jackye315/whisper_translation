00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
How long has it been since I've forgotten about you?

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Tell me about your favorite story

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
I think of you very much

I think of you very much

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
I think of you very much

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
I start to panic

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000

You cry and say to me

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
The pain is all lies

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
I can't be your prince

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Maybe you don't understand

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
From the day you said you loved me

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
My sky is cold

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
I wish to become a fairy

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
The angel you love

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Open your hands and become wings

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
To protect you

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You have to believe

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Believe that we will share the same story

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
Happiness and happiness are the ending
