How long has it been since I've forgotten about you?
Tell me about your favorite story
I think of you very much
I think of you very much
I think of you very much
I start to panic
Did I do something wrong?
You cry and say to me
The pain is all lies
I can't be your prince
Maybe you don't understand
From the day you said you loved me
My sky is cold
I wish to become a fairy
The angel you love
Open your hands and become wings
To protect you
You have to believe
Believe that we will share the same story
Happiness and happiness are the ending
